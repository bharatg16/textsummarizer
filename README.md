# Trash Classification
CNN Image classification of trash of 6 categories in TensorFlow and PyTorch

**Trash data categories from Kaggle included:**
- Plastic
- Metal
- Paper
- Cardboard
- Glass
- Trash

Implemented a simple CNN network training from scratch on TensorFlow

Implemented Transfer Learning on two ResNet models of different model complexity:
- ResNet18
- ResNext101-32d8 (Experimental Dropout at last FC layer)

Implemented a web interface + acquire new observations for trainning using Flask
